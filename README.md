# windows-keyboard-layout

This is essentially an **English US** keyboard layout suited for **french accents**. All dead keys are hidden behind the Alt modifier. In other words, this is an **English US International** keyboard layout without the dead key annoyance on characters such as `'`, `` ` ``, etc..
